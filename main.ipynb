    "The shell script file *commandline_original.sh* is implemented as requested and the output correspond to what it's expected, the only difference we find it's the transformation of special characters like 'Åš' in 'Åšwiatowe' to their unicode counterpart, as '\\u015'. Comment on the code is inside the file itself but we briefly describe the code here: for each line of the json file we extract 'id' and 'title' of the series and than the whole \"works\" subsection using Regexs. From the \"works\" subsection we search every field 'work_counts', sum the value, store it in an accumulator and append everything in a list. After having gone through every line of the json file we sort the list using only the total work counts field and using a for cycle print the first five results following the format of the table shown.\n",

    "\n",
    "We explicitely said not to use jq to avoid using external libraries. The result is stored in *commandline_LLM.sh* and it doesn't work. We can immediately see it from the different output and the fact that in the source code it's never mentioned the field \"books_count\". We also tried to use alternative LLMs chatbots like Bing with similar results. Removing the costraint of using only three lines the results become correct but also extremely similar to the original code. Meanwhile giving only the text of the question does not bring positive results."
