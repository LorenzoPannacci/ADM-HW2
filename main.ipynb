    "1. Splitting the input string: \n",
    "   `input_list = input_string.split(\"\\n\")`\n",
    "   This operation splits the input string into a list of lines, which takes O(n) time, where n is the number of characters in the input string.\n",

    "   a. Splitting the command:\n",
    "      `command = input_list[i].split(\" \")`\n",
    "      Splitting a string into a list has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of characters in the string.\n",

    "   b. Checking the command type (if-elif statements):\n",

    "   c. Performing actions based on the command:\n",

    "      - In the case of the \"?\" command, it searches for an item in the list using the `index` method. In the worst case, this can take O(n) time if the item is at the end of the list.\n",

    "Within each iteration of the loop, there are O(k) operations, where k is the maximum number of elements in the shelf and output lists.\n",
    "Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithmic_question function can be expressed as O(n_commands * k), where n_commands is the number of instructions and k is the maximum number of elements in the shelf and output lists. In the worst case, k can be n (number of instructions), so the time complexity is O(n_commands * n), or simply O(n^2), where n is the number of instructions.\n",

This line search the index corresponding to a certain element in a python deque and for doing so it has to check element by element if the object in the deque is the current one. The worst-case scenario for this operation is when the element is found as the last checked element, making the operation runs at O(m) time with m length of the deque.\n",

The worst case scenario is if we first insert all the O(n) elements and then do all the O(n) search operations, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n^2).\n",
